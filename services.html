          <p class="section-subtitle" style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
            Most projects follow a simple flow: discovery, concept, feedback, and final delivery. You’ll always see previews
            before anything is finalised.
          </p>
          <p class="hero-note">
            1) Discovery – You share goals, references, and timelines.  
            2) Design – I explore layouts, colours, and typography.  
            3) Refine – We fine‑tune based on your feedback and prepare final files.

          <h3 class="section-title" style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
          <div class="hero-note" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
            <p><strong>How long does a typical project take?</strong><br />
              Most single posters or thumbnails take 2–4 days, while full sets or campaigns can take 1–2 weeks depending
              on complexity and feedback rounds.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p><strong>What do you need from me to get started?</strong><br />
              A short brief, any text you already have, your logo (if available), brand colours, and 2–3 visual references
              that match the mood you’re aiming for.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p><strong>In which formats will I receive the final files?</strong><br />
              You’ll receive exports in PNG/JPEG for sharing and PDF for print where needed. Editable source files can
              also be shared on request.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p><strong>Can you help with ongoing content, not just one‑off designs?</strong><br />
              Yes. If you need regular social media or thumbnail designs, we can set up a simple recurring arrangement
              to keep your visuals consistent every month.
